Hey there everyone! Welcome to my first blog post ever about cool coding techniques I learned this semester at The University of Texas!</p>
<p>In my SDS 348 class, we have learned how to interact two programming languages, R code and Python. In this blog, I will be disussing some basic steps on how both these two programming worlds can colide and work together!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)

UT&lt;-&quot;Hook&#39;em&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>#Python code
UT=&quot;horns forever!&quot;
print(r.UT,UT)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Hook&#39;em horns forever!</code></pre>
<p>I am a graduating senior this semester, so I am just beaming with pride for my school during this time of the year. My apologies if you go to Texas A&amp;M or don’t like the color burnt orange! I first begin with an R chunk, and then I created a python chunk. By using the “print()” function, I was able to access the R defined code,named “UT”, to join both the R and Python chunks to complete my phrase “Hook’em horns forever!”. Pretty neat! Basically, you can now speak in two (programming) languages now!</p>
<p>Another cool feature in Python, is that you can use “re.match()” to return any part of a string that matches. In my example, I created a string, “My string is”Bevo is the coolest mascot!&quot; and found the match of the string between “bevo” and “the”. Notice that you must prefix the original expression with an “r”.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import re
string=&quot;Bevo is the coolest mascot!&quot;
match=re.match(r&quot;Bevo.*the&quot;,string)
match.group()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &#39;Bevo is the&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s say you want to change the phrases in the original string. You can also substitute matches in a string with replacement by using the “re.sub()” function.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>string=&quot;Bevo is the coolest mascot!&quot;
re.sub(r&quot;coolest.* mascot&quot;,&quot;burnt orange cow&quot;,string)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &#39;Bevo is the burnt orange cow!&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Notice how I indicated what part of the string I wanted to change, beginning at “coolest” and ending at “mascot”, and replaced it with “burnt orange cow”.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to show you how to find the number of times a certain instance occurs within a given string. The example below demonstrates how many times the word “bevo” occurs followed by anythin in the string.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>x= &quot;bevo bevomoos burntorangebevo bevomybevo hornsonbevo bestmascotbevoUT whereisbevo&quot;
re.findall(r&quot;bevo&quot;,x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [&#39;bevo&#39;, &#39;bevo&#39;, &#39;bevo&#39;, &#39;bevo&#39;, &#39;bevo&#39;, &#39;bevo&#39;, &#39;bevo&#39;, &#39;bevo&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>By using “re.findall()”, I am able to see that there are a total of 8 matches of “bevo” in the string called “x”. Again, remember to prefix the expression with an “r”.</p>
<p>I will show another example of this same technique to find how many times the letter “b” is followed by the letter “v”.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>x= &quot;bevo bevomoos burntorangebevo bevomybevo hornsonbevo bestmascotbevoUT whereisbevo&quot;
re.findall(r&quot;b.v&quot;,x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [&#39;bev&#39;, &#39;bev&#39;, &#39;bev&#39;, &#39;bev&#39;, &#39;bev&#39;, &#39;bev&#39;, &#39;bev&#39;, &#39;bev&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>It appears a total of 8 times!</p>
<p>All in all, there are many more ways on how to interact R code and Python, but I hope you found this blog post useful and gained some new insight on how to interact programming languages.
