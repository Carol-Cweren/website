Hey there everyone! Welcome to my first blog post ever about cool coding techniques I learned this semester at The University of Texas!

In my SDS 348 class, we have learned how to interact two programming languages, R code and Python. In this blog, I will be disussing some basic steps on how both these two programming worlds can colide and work together!


```{r}
library(reticulate)

UT<-"Hook'em"
```

```{python}
#Python code
UT="horns forever!"
print(r.UT,UT)
```
I am a graduating senior this semester, so I  am just beaming with pride for my school during this time of the year. My apologies if you go to Texas A&M or don't like the color burnt orange! I first begin with an R chunk, and then I created a python chunk. By using the "print()" function, I was able to access the R defined code,named "UT", to join both the R and Python chunks to complete my phrase "Hook'em horns forever!". Pretty neat! Basically, you can now speak in two (programming) languages now!


Another cool feature in Python, is that you can use "re.match()" to return any part of a string that matches. In my example, I created a string, "My string is "Bevo is the coolest mascot!" and found the match of the string between "bevo" and "the". Notice that you must prefix the original expression with an "r". 
```{python}
import re
string="Bevo is the coolest mascot!"
match=re.match(r"Bevo.*the",string)
match.group()
```

Now let's say you want to change the phrases in the original string. You can also substitute matches in a string with  replacement by using the "re.sub()" function.
```{python}
string="Bevo is the coolest mascot!"
re.sub(r"coolest.* mascot","burnt orange cow",string)
```
Notice how I indicated what part of the string I wanted to change, beginning at "coolest" and ending at "mascot", and replaced it with "burnt orange cow". 

Lastly, I want to show you how to find the number of times a certain instance occurs within a given string. The example below demonstrates how many times the word "bevo" occurs followed by anythin in the string.
```{python}
x= "bevo bevomoos burntorangebevo bevomybevo hornsonbevo bestmascotbevoUT whereisbevo"
re.findall(r"bevo",x)
```
By using "re.findall()", I am able to see that there are a total of 8 matches of "bevo" in the string called "x". Again, remember to prefix the expression with an "r". 

I will show another example of this same technique to find how many times the letter "b" is followed by the letter "v".
```{python}
x= "bevo bevomoos burntorangebevo bevomybevo hornsonbevo bestmascotbevoUT whereisbevo"
re.findall(r"b.v",x)
```
It appears a total of 8 times!

All in all, there are many more ways on how to interact R code and Python, but I hope you found this blog post useful and gained some new insight on how to interact programming languages.
